# Steganography-Python
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. This python app implements steganography using image files (PNGs) and allows you to hide text in an image and also retrieve the hidden text from an image.
